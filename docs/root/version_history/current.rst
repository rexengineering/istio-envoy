1.15.0 (Pending)
================

Changes
-------

* http: fixed a bug where the upgrade header was not cleared on responses to non-upgrade requests.
  Can be reverted temporarily by setting runtime feature `envoy.reloadable_features.fix_upgrade_response` to false.
* tracing: tracing configuration has been made fully dynamic and every HTTP connection manager
  can now have a separate :ref:`tracing provider <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.Tracing.provider>`.

Deprecated
----------

* Tracing provider configuration as part of :ref:`bootstrap config <envoy_v3_api_field_config.bootstrap.v3.Bootstrap.tracing>`
  has been deprecated in favor of configuration as part of :ref:`HTTP connection manager
  <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager.Tracing.provider>`.
